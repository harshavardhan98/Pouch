# Privacy Policy — Pouch

## Overview

Pouch is a privacy-focused Chrome extension for saving and organizing links. Your privacy is not just a feature — it is the foundation of this extension.

## Data Collection

Pouch does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data. Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected (no names, emails, or accounts).
- **No browsing history** is tracked or recorded beyond the links you explicitly choose to save.
- **No analytics or telemetry** of any kind are used.
- **No cookies** are set by the extension.
- **No third-party services** are contacted.

## Data Storage

All data — including saved links, tags, and user preferences — is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This data never leaves your device.

## Data Sharing

Pouch does not share any data with third parties. There are no servers, APIs, or external endpoints involved.

## Export and Import

Pouch allows you to export your saved links as a JSON file and import them back. These operations happen entirely on your device. No data is uploaded or transmitted during this process.

## Permissions

Pouch requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **activeTab** — To read the title and URL of the current tab when you click the extension icon.
- **storage** — To save and retrieve your link collection locally within the browser.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. Since Pouch does not collect any data, meaningful changes to this policy are unlikely.

**In short: Pouch doesn't collect your data. Period.**
